# Physics Calculation Telegram Bot

## **Description:**
This is a Telegram bot designed to help users calculate physical quantities like average velocity, average acceleration, and displacement from a set of time-location data. The bot uses a simple and user-friendly interface to allow users to input their time and location values, and then computes various physics formulas and presents the results with visual graphs.

**Key Features:**
- Calculates average velocity (`V_avg`), average acceleration (`A_avg`), and overall displacement (`S_avg`).
- Displays results in a clean and understandable format.
- Generates graphs for time vs. position, average velocity, and acceleration.
- Interactive user experience using Telegram buttons to guide the user through the data input and calculation process.

## **Installation:**

### **Pre-requisites:**
1. Python 3.10 or later.
2. Libraries:
   - `python-telegram-bot`
   - `numpy`
   - `matplotlib`

You can install the required Python libraries with the following command:
```bash
pip install python-telegram-bot numpy matplotlib
```

---

### **Steps for Installation:**

1. **Download or Clone the Repository:**
   Clone the repository to your local machine or download it as a zip file.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Physics-Telegram-Bot.git
   ```

2. **Configure the Bot Token:**
   - Open the `config.json` file in the project directory.
   - Replace the empty string `""` with your actual Telegram Bot token, which you can get from [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather).

   Example:
   ```json
   {
       "BOT_TOKEN": "your-telegram-bot-token-here"
   }
   ```

3. **Run the Bot:**
   After setting the bot token, you can run the bot script.

   - On Linux:
     ```bash
     python3 bot.py
     ```

   - On Windows:
     Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:
     ```bash
     python bot.py
     ```

4. **Running the Bot:**
   Once the bot is running, it will be available for use through Telegram. You can send time and location data, and it will respond with the calculated results and graphs.

## **How to Use the Bot:**

1. **Start the Bot:**
   Open Telegram and search for your bot by its username or directly through the bot link. Send `/start` to begin the interaction.

2. **Data Input:**
   The bot will ask for the following information:
   - **Time (T)**: Enter the time at which a measurement was taken.
   - **Location (X)**: Enter the location (or position) corresponding to the time.

   You can add multiple points for a more accurate calculation. After entering at least two points, you can proceed to the calculations.

3. **Perform Calculations:**
   Once enough data points are entered, the bot will perform the following calculations:
   - **Average Velocity (V_avg)**: Calculates the average velocity between each pair of points.
   - **Average Acceleration (A_avg)**: Computes the average acceleration between each pair of velocities.
   - **Overall Displacement (S_avg)**: Computes the total displacement between the first and last points.

   The bot will also generate a graph with time vs. position, average velocity, and average acceleration.

4. **Sample Input & Output:**

   **Input:**
   ```
   Time: 0   Location: 0
   Time: 1   Location: 4
   Time: 2   Location: 5
   Time: 3   Location: 2
   ```

   **Output:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Calculations Completed:

   1Ô∏è‚É£ **Average Velocity between each pair of points:**
   V_avg = ŒîX / ŒîT
   Results: V_avg = [4.0, 1.0, -3.0]

   2Ô∏è‚É£ **Average Acceleration between velocities:**
   A_avg = ŒîV / ŒîT
   Results: A_avg = [-3.0, -4.0]

   3Ô∏è‚É£ **Overall Displacement (S_avg):**
   S_avg = ŒîX / ŒîT
   S_avg = (2 - 0) / (3 - 0) = 2 / 3 = 0.6667

   üîπ **Summary:**
   V_avg: [4.0, 1.0, -3.0]
   A_avg: [-3.0, -4.0]
   S_avg: 0.667
   ```

5. **Graphs:**
   After the calculations, the bot will provide a graphical representation of:
   - Time vs. Position
   - Time vs. Average Velocity
   - Time vs. Average Acceleration
